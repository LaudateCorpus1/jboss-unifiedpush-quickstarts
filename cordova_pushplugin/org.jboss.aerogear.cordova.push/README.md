# JBoss Mobile Add-On PushPlugin for Cordova
---------

`JBoss Mobile Add-On PushPlugin for Cordova` is an extension of the standard Cordova Push Plugin and provides support for integrating with push and registering Cordova applications with the JBoss Mobile UnifiedPush Server, while making your javascript less verbose and easier to maintain. It currently supports Googleâ€™s Cloud Messaging (GCM) and Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS) with the JBoss Mobile UnifiedPush Server.

## How do I use it?

###0. System Requirements

* [Apache Cordova CLI](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* Install Cordova by executing:
  ```shell
  $ npm install -g cordova
  ```
  To deploy on iOS you need to install also the ios-deploy package:
  ```shell
  npm install -g ios-deploy
  ```

###1. Pre-requisites

Before building the application, you must register the Android or iOS variant of the application with a running JBoss Mobile UnifiedPush Server instance and Google Cloud Messaging for Android or Apple Push Notification Service for iOS. The resulting unique IDs and other parameters must then be inserted into the application source code. After this is complete, the application can be built and deployed to Android or iOS devices.

For the configuration and registration of Android or iOS Applications with GCM or APNS, please refer to the specific guides inside `JBoss Mobile Add-On for Android` and `JBoss Mobile Add-On for iOS` libraries.

###2. Use JBoss Mobile Add-On PushPlugin for Cordova

Extract the `JBoss Mobile Add-On PushPlugin for Cordova` and install it specifying the local path to the plugin directory that contains the `plugin.xml` file, executing the following command from within your project folder:
```shell
cordova plugin add <path-to-org.jboss.aerogear.cordova.push-dir>
```

Done! Your project now contains the JBoss Mobile Add-On PushPlugin. For an integration with the `JBoss Mobile Add-On UnifiedPush Server` open the `www` folder in your text editor and apply the code from the example below. You can then execute the project with the command:
```shell
cordova run <android or ios>
```
## Example Usage
###1. Register the application
The following JavaScript code shows how to register a device with the JBoss Mobile Add-On UnifiedPush Server. You need to change `pushServerURL` with the url of your UnifiedPush Server instance. You also need to change `senderID`, `variantID` and `variantSecret` with the values assigned by UnifiedPush Server and GCM or APNS:
```
var pushConfig = {
    pushServerURL: "<pushServerURL e.g http(s)//host:port/context >",
    alias: "<alias e.g. a username or an email address optional>",
    android: {
      senderID: "<senderID e.g Google Project ID only for android>",
      variantID: "<variantID e.g. 1234456-234320>",
      variantSecret: "<variantSecret e.g. 1234456-234320>"
    },
    ios: {
      variantID: "<variantID e.g. 1234456-234320>",
      variantSecret: "<variantSecret e.g. 1234456-234320>"
    }
};

push.register(onNotification, successHandler, errorHandler, pushConfig);
```

If you are only targeting one platform, you can simplify the code above by:

```
var pushConfig = {
    pushServerURL: "<pushServerURL e.g http(s)//host:port/context >",
    alias: "<alias e.g. a username or an email address optional>",
    variantID: "<ios variantID e.g. 1234456-234320>",
    variantSecret: "<ios variantSecret e.g. 1234456-234320>"
};

push.register(onNotification, successHandler, errorHandler, pushConfig);
```

###2. Receive Remote Notifications
The `onNotification` callback will get executed by the plugin when a new message arrives. 
```
function onNotification(event) {
    alert(event.alert);
}
```

The passed in `event` object contains:

* `alert`: the alert message send
* `coldstart`: information whether the app was running when the message was received
* `badge`: the number to display on the icon (iOS specific)
* any custom set of properties that are available under e.payload ( e.g `alert(e.payload.foo);` )


#### iOS Background Notification
Sending notifications that contain `content-available` on iOS will call the JavaScript before launching the application. This will enable you to update the UI or do a silent push (e.g. without an alert) to update the content of your application without the user noticing.  After fetching the content, you'll have to _inform_ the os about the result by calling `setContentAvailable` with either `NewData`, `NoData` or `Failed`:

```
function onNotification(event) {

  if (event['content-available'] === 1) {
    if (!event.foreground) {
      // fetch content
      push.setContentAvailable(push.FetchResult.NewData);
    }
  }
}
```

###3. Unregister the Application (only available on Android):

```
push.unregister(successHandler, errorHandler);

function successHandler() {
    console.log('success')
}

function errorHandler(message) {
    console.log('error ' + message);
}
```
